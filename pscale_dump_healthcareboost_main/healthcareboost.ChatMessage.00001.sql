(1,"What is a \"serverless function\"?","A serverless function, also known as a serverless compute service or function as a service (FaaS), is a type of cloud computing service that enables developers to write and deploy code without the need to manage underlying infrastructure or servers.\n\nIn traditional server-based architectures, developers need to provision and maintain servers to run their applications. With serverless computing, developers can focus solely on writing the application logic, while the cloud provider takes care of managing and scaling the infrastructure.\n\nIn a serverless function model, developers write functions (pieces of code) that get triggered in response to specific events or requests. These functions execute in a managed and isolated runtime environment provided by the cloud provider whenever an event occurs. The cloud provider automatically scales the execution environment based on the incoming workload, so developers don\'t have to worry about provisioning resources.\n\nServerless functions can be used for various purposes, such as running background tasks, handling API requests, processing events from various sources (e.g., databases, message queues), and building event-driven architectures. They offer the benefits of reduced operational overhead, automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and high availability, making it easier and more cost-effective to build and deploy applications at scale.","clmys1oc70009uy7spp31f4re","2023-09-25 15:15:44.902","2023-09-25 15:15:44.902"),

(5,"Tell me about google ads","Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an online advertising platform developed by Google. It allows businesses to create and display ads on Google\'s search engine results pages (SERPs) and across the Google Display Network.\n\nAdvertisers use Google Ads to promote their products, services, or brand to potential customers. The platform works on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning advertisers are charged only when someone clicks on their ads. This makes it a cost-effective way for businesses to reach their target audience.\n\nTo set up a Google Ads campaign, advertisers need to select their campaign goals, such as increasing website traffic, generating leads, or boosting sales. They also choose their ad format, which can be text-based search ads, display ads (including banners, images, or rich media), video ads, or app ads.\n\nKeywords play a significant role in Google Ads. Advertisers choose relevant keywords that they want their ads to appear for when users search on Google. The ads are then displayed alongside organic search results or on relevant websites within the Google Display Network. Advertisers bid on keywords and compete with other advertisers to have their ads shown.\n\nGoogle Ads provides several targeting options to advertisers. They can target specific geographic locations, demographics, interests, or even specific websites or apps within the Display Network. Advertisers can also remarket to previous visitors of their website or target audiences similar to their existing customers.\n\nThe platform provides extensive performance metrics and analytics to measure the success of campaigns. Advertisers can track metrics such as impressions, clicks, click-through rates (CTRs), conversion rates, and return on investment (ROI) to assess the effectiveness of their ads. This data helps them make informed decisions and optimize their campaigns for better results.\n\nOverall, Google Ads offers businesses a powerful platform for advertising and reaching a vast audience. It provides various targeting options, flexibility in ad formats, and a pay-per-click model, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes.","clr23nzqy0001uybseczxkfa6","2024-01-06 13:27:58.329","2024-01-06 13:27:58.329"),
