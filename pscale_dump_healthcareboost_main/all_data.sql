(1,"What is a \"serverless function\"?","A serverless function, also known as a serverless compute service or function as a service (FaaS), is a type of cloud computing service that enables developers to write and deploy code without the need to manage underlying infrastructure or servers.\n\nIn traditional server-based architectures, developers need to provision and maintain servers to run their applications. With serverless computing, developers can focus solely on writing the application logic, while the cloud provider takes care of managing and scaling the infrastructure.\n\nIn a serverless function model, developers write functions (pieces of code) that get triggered in response to specific events or requests. These functions execute in a managed and isolated runtime environment provided by the cloud provider whenever an event occurs. The cloud provider automatically scales the execution environment based on the incoming workload, so developers don\'t have to worry about provisioning resources.\n\nServerless functions can be used for various purposes, such as running background tasks, handling API requests, processing events from various sources (e.g., databases, message queues), and building event-driven architectures. They offer the benefits of reduced operational overhead, automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and high availability, making it easier and more cost-effective to build and deploy applications at scale.","clmys1oc70009uy7spp31f4re","2023-09-25 15:15:44.902","2023-09-25 15:15:44.902"),

(5,"Tell me about google ads","Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an online advertising platform developed by Google. It allows businesses to create and display ads on Google\'s search engine results pages (SERPs) and across the Google Display Network.\n\nAdvertisers use Google Ads to promote their products, services, or brand to potential customers. The platform works on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, meaning advertisers are charged only when someone clicks on their ads. This makes it a cost-effective way for businesses to reach their target audience.\n\nTo set up a Google Ads campaign, advertisers need to select their campaign goals, such as increasing website traffic, generating leads, or boosting sales. They also choose their ad format, which can be text-based search ads, display ads (including banners, images, or rich media), video ads, or app ads.\n\nKeywords play a significant role in Google Ads. Advertisers choose relevant keywords that they want their ads to appear for when users search on Google. The ads are then displayed alongside organic search results or on relevant websites within the Google Display Network. Advertisers bid on keywords and compete with other advertisers to have their ads shown.\n\nGoogle Ads provides several targeting options to advertisers. They can target specific geographic locations, demographics, interests, or even specific websites or apps within the Display Network. Advertisers can also remarket to previous visitors of their website or target audiences similar to their existing customers.\n\nThe platform provides extensive performance metrics and analytics to measure the success of campaigns. Advertisers can track metrics such as impressions, clicks, click-through rates (CTRs), conversion rates, and return on investment (ROI) to assess the effectiveness of their ads. This data helps them make informed decisions and optimize their campaigns for better results.\n\nOverall, Google Ads offers businesses a powerful platform for advertising and reaching a vast audience. It provides various targeting options, flexibility in ad formats, and a pay-per-click model, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes.","clr23nzqy0001uybseczxkfa6","2024-01-06 13:27:58.329","2024-01-06 13:27:58.329"),

Most crème brûlée recipes require the use of a small propane torch to achieve the crackly sugar top, but this version offers a simpler (and safer) solution: your oven\'s broiler. One thing to note: Be sure to let the custard set for several hours in the refrigerator before brûléeing the top, otherwise you\'ll end up with soupy custard.","Step 1\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt and cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)\n\nStep 2\nIn a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.\n\nStep 3\nWhen ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within two hours.","No video","2023-05-08 09:31:19.004","2023-05-15 07:06:41.419",0,1,60),

Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it\'s by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!","Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.\n\nCombine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes.

Not too spicy, so perfect for a family meal (add hot sauce if you like heat!).","Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 400°F.\nCook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.\nMake the chili: Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they have broken down slightly and some of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add the ground beef, black pepper, 1 tablespoon chili powder, and 1 tablespoon salt to the onion-tomato mixture. Cook, breaking up the ground beef with a wooden spoon, until brown and fully cooked, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.\nMake the cheese sauce: Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until bubbly and slightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly whisk the milk into the butter-flour mixture. At first, the mixture will seize up and look crumbly, but will smooth out as you keep adding milk and whisking. Once all the milk is added, bring to a simmer. Whisk frequently and scrape along the bottom of the pan, so it doesn\'t burn. Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly and seems creamy, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and add the shredded cheese and mustard. Stir until the cheese has melted. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.\nAssemble the mac and cheese: Combine the cooked pasta, chili mixture, and cheese sauce – you can do this in your skillet if it\'s big enough, otherwise use a large bowl. Mix until evenly combine, then transfer back to the skillet used to cook the chili. (Or transfer to a baking dish if your skillet isn\'t big enough.)\nTop with toasted breadcrumbs: Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter and mix with the breadcrumbs, ½ teaspoon chili powder, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Sprinkle evenly over top the chili mac and cheese.\nBake the mac and cheese: Place the chili mac and cheese in the oven and bake until golden on top and the cheese sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Leftovers can be kept refrigerated for about a week. Reheat individual portions in the microwave, or larger amounts in a low oven. Leftovers can also be frozen in individual portions for up to 3 months; reheat in the microwave or in a low oven.","No video","2023-05-08 15:55:20.925","2023-05-15 07:06:41.419",0,1,55),

Preheat the oven to 425F. Cover a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.</li><li>2. Make the biscuits: sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a large bowl.

Using a fork, gradually mix in the yogurt, then the milk, until the dough is quite soft and somewhat sticky. Work quickly without overworking the dough.

Transfer the sausage patties to a warmed platter and keep warm.</li><li>5. Make the gravy: Add enough of the butter to the skillet so the bottom is covered with 1/8 inch of fat. Stir, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the flour slowly, stirring until it has absorbed the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown, at least 2 minutes. Then slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly, and cook until the gravy thickens to the consistency of very heavy cream.<</li><li>6. To serve, split two biscuits in half.
